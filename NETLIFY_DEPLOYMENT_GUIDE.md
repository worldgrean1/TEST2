# Netlify Deployment Guide

## ✅ Fixed Issues

The Netlify deployment error has been resolved by fixing the configuration mismatch between Next.js static export and the Netlify Next.js plugin.

### Changes Made:

1. **Next.js Configuration (`next.config.mjs`)**:
   - Disabled `output: 'export'` to allow Netlify plugin to work properly
   - Kept all other optimizations for Netlify compatibility

2. **Netlify Configuration (`netlify.toml`)**:
   - Changed publish directory from `"out"` to `".next"`
   - Commented out SPA fallback redirect (handled by Next.js plugin)
   - Kept Next.js plugin configuration

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Option 1: GitHub Integration (Recommended)

1. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Netlify deployment configuration"

2. **Connect to Netlify**:
   - Go to [Netlify Dashboard](https://app.netlify.com/)
   - Click "New site from Git"

### Option 2: Manual Deploy
